# Bar Chart Race: SOP Contributions

## Description

This bar chart race visualizes all the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) I have authored from scratch since joining the SOP Writers Team at Achieve. The animation highlights the number of SOPs created per department, showcasing how my contributions have evolved across different teams.

Due to space limitations within the video frame, only the top 10 departments are displayed. The chart also illustrates how different departments have overlapped in assigning SOPs to me over time.
